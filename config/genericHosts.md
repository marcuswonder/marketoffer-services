Generic Host Filtering

Policy
- Block common search engines, social networks, review sites, business directories, property portals, marketplaces, and public-data sites.
- Use base domains only; the app filters both exact matches and any subdomains (host endsWith .domain).
- Prefer deterministic rules; keep list focused and review periodically.

How Itâ€™s Used
- companyDiscovery loads `genericHosts.json` and excludes any result whose host equals or ends with a listed domain.
- The list is lowercased at load time.

Maintenance Tips
- Add base domains (e.g., `yelp.com`), not subdomains (e.g., `m.yelp.com`).
- Avoid adding specific brand/company websites unless they are truly directory-like; overblocking increases false negatives.
- Consider adding platform bases instead of many regional subdomains (e.g., `pinterest.com`, `wordpress.com`).
- If a domain should be allowed despite matching this list, add it to an allowlist in code or a separate file (future enhancement).
